1:CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

• Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
• Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
• External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.

2:Cascading Order:

Number one has the highest priority:

1-Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2-External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3-Browser default
So, an <br>inline style has the highest priority</br>, and will override <br>external</br> and <br>internal styles</br> and <br>browser defaults</br>.

3:Opacity / Transparency

The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a <br>value from 0.0 - 1.0</br>.The lower value, the more transparent.
<p><b>note:</b> When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read.
<br>
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values. The following example sets the opacity for the background color and not the text.

7:CSS background - Shorthand property

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.
